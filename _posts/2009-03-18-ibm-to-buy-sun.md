<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/19/business/19markets.html" target="_new">The New York Times is reporting</a> (via <a title="http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/2g-zycOTk5o/article.pl" href="http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/2g-zycOTk5o/article.pl" target="_new">Slashdot</a>) that IBM and Sun are in talks regarding the former acquiring the latter.
<blockquote>The Wall Street Journal, quoting “people familiar with the matter,” reported Wednesday that International Business Machines was in talks to buy Sun for at least $6.5 billion in cash, a premium of more than 100 percent over the company’s closing share price Tuesday. Officials of Sun and IBM could not immediately be reached for comment.</blockquote>

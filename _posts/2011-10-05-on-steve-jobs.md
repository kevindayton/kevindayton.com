Like many others, Steve Jobs inspired me.  About a year ago, a colleague of mine and I were in Santa Clara, CA for a developers conference.  On the last day, there was a long stretch between the closing keynote and our flight out, and I insisted that we take a short detour on our way to San Jose and see Apple HQ.  It was only a quick stop on a nerd pilgrimage, but a small part of me thought that we'd get a look at Jobs.

It didn't happen, but seeing 1 Infinite Loop was an opportunity to pay homage to  man and a company that has inspired me greatly over the last 15 years.  From the first time I used a Mac in journalism school to the iPod reinvigorating my love for music to the time spent building an iPad app at work this week, my adult life has been unmistakably marked by Jobs's vision at Apple.

He was an inspiration and a visionary and will be missed.  God rest his soul.

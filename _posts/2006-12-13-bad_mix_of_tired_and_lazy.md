post_title: Bad mix of tired and lazy
author: Kevin L. Dayton
post_excerpt: |
  After all of my excitement about getting this site back up and online, I have quickly been reminded why it took me so long to get it back in the first place.  I have been hit with a bad one-two punch of tired and lazy.  Work has been really busy of late.  That along with a new house and adjusting to married life has meant that I haven't really felt like doing much when I have extra time.

KevinDayton.com has paid the price for this.  I'm hoping that as the Christmas season passes, my life will settle down a little bit and I can put new effort into this site.  I make no promises, though.  Anyway, I just wanted to put out an 'I'm still alive and still plan to add items to this site' message.  Please continue to stay tuned.

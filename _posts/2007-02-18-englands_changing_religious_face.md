For the first time since the Protestant Reformation hit the British Isles, Catholics are on the verge of becoming the majority religion among Britons.  This according to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article1386939.ece" title="Catholics set to pass Anglicans as leading UK church-News-TimesOnline" target="_new">The London Times</a> (and echoed by <a href="http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=49304" title="Catholic World News (CWN)" target="_new">CWN</a>).  A combination of immigration from Catholic countries and a steady decline within the Anglican church has led to this distinction.

An interesting note in the article is that the influx of Catholics has been overwhelming in certain areas.  With average Sunday mass attendance up to one million people, the Times describes the situation as both the church's biggest threat and biggest opportunity.  According to the article, the surge of workers from countries like Poland (~95% Catholic) has caused some parishes, especially in London, to offer masses from 8 A.M. to 8 P.M.

The interesting question is what is happening amongst the actual British people.  Once a proud society centered around Christian religious life has slowly faded toward atheism.  The Anglican Church seems to be gasping for air along with its sister chruches around the world in the Anglican Communion.  Catholicism still seems to be a four-letter word considering to this day an English king or queen can neither be Catholic or marry one.   

On top of all this is the issue that all of Europe faces, how long before Islam takes over?  A challenge that could change the face of Europe is going virtually ignored in religious circles.  Thank God for Pope Benedict XVI.  Whether or not Catholics, Anglicans, protestants, and evangelicals understand it, Benedict is out in front, putting his life on the line to defend Christianity in relation to Islam.  Catholic and non-Catholic alike should applaud and respect him for this.

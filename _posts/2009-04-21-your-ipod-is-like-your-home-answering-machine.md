<blockquote>..."I guarantee you it will be hard to sell an iPod five or seven years from now when every cell phone can access your entire music library wherever you are."  -- Sun CEO, Scott McNealy in a <a title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/12/sun_apple_snapple/" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/12/sun_apple_snapple/" target="_blank">2006 article at The Register</a>.</blockquote>
Being big tech industry news, <a title="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/21/oracle-to-acquire-sun-for-7-4-billion/" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/21/oracle-to-acquire-sun-for-7-4-billion/" target="_blank">MacRumors posted a note</a> on the Oracle buyout of Sun.  It points out that Sun attempted to buy Apple once, and there were two occasions where the companies nearly merged.  MR cites a <a title="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/12/sun_apple_snapple/" href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/01/12/sun_apple_snapple/" target="_blank">2006 article at The Register</a> with Sun co-founder Bill Joy that I quoted above.

The article points out Scott McNealy's hesitance toward Apple, especially the long range success of the iPod, which prompted the quote.   In retrospect, that quote looks so funny with my iPhone setting on my desk and <a title="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/08/07/new_software_would_let_iphones_access_itunes_libraries_from_anywhere.html" href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/08/07/new_software_would_let_iphones_access_itunes_libraries_from_anywhere.html" target="_blank">talks that Apple is developing technology to stream music from your desktop to you Internet-connected iPhone or iPod</a> anywhere in the world.  Three years later, Apple is going strong, and Sun has been gobbled up.

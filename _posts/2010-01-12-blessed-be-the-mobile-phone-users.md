In a strange mix of religion and technology, <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article6984258.ece">the Times is reporting</a> on the Anglican parish of St. Lawrence Jewry in London holding a public "blessing of the smartphones."  Apparently picking up on the medieval "<a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plough_Monday" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plough_Monday" target="_blank">Plough Monday</a>" tradition of blessing agricultural equipment,  the Rev. Canon David  Parrott allowed iPhones, BlackBerrys and laptops to be place on the altar for a special blessing.
<blockquote>This was Church 2.0. Behind him, the altar resembled a counter at PC World.  Upon it, laid out like holy relics, were four smart phones, one Apple laptop  and one Dell...

...Then, after another hymn, came the blessing of the smart phones. The Lord  Mayor of London offered his BlackBerry to Canon Parrott, which was received  with due reverence and placed upon the altar.

Then the congregation held their phones in the air, and Canon Parrott  addressed the Almighty. “By your blessing, may these phones and computers,  symbols of all the technology and communication in our daily lives, be a  reminder to us that you are a God who communicates with us and who speaks by  your Word. Amen.”</blockquote>
Despite my affinity for both Church and tech, I find all of this a bit bizarre.

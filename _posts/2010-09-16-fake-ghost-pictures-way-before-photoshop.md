<blockquote>The results were spooky. Even knowing that they are fake, I look at them  and feel the chills today. Imagine how it was back then. Even very  smart people, like Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, bought into it. When Hope was  exposed as a scam artist by the Society for Psychical Research, the  writer defended him.</blockquote>
Cool, but indeed, very spooky.

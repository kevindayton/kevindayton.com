  The Apple iPhone is a reality (<a href="http://kevindayton.com/?q=node/6" title="iPhone released...by Cisco (Updated) | KevinDayton.com">despite Cisco's trademarks</a>).  I had written a long blog entry about Apple's latest beauty.  Unforunately, my browser crashed in the process, and I lost it all.  I don't have the energy to go through it all again when you can go to Apple's site and get a better rundown than I can provide.

The Apple iPhone is a reality (<a title="iPhone released...by Cisco (Updated) | KevinDayton.com" href="http://kevindayton.com/?q=node/6">despite Cisco's trademarks</a>).  I had written a long blog entry about Apple's latest beauty.  Unforunately, my browser crashed in the process, and I lost it all.

I think this device looks awesome.  I only wish it had 3G wireless data connectivity and was being sold unlocked.  Alas, it is exclusively for Cingular's EDGE (2.5G) network.  I will be curious to see if Cingular changes its data plans to support a very data intensive phone.  That being said, I'll buy it the second I have $500 to spare.

Check out <a title="Apple - iPhone" href="http://apple.com/iphone/">Apple's site</a>, and take note of the cool features like the advanced touch screen interface, advanced orientation sensors, as well as info in many ways to get information.  It is said to run on slim version of OS X and contains full web browsing, e-mail and SMS capability.

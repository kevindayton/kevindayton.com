    Since this site went down in May of 2005, a lot of things have happened.  Most of them were good and a few bad.  Instead of droning on trying to fill you in on everything, I've compiled a top 5 list to get you caught up.

<strong>#5 - Getting a real job</strong>
This is part of the reason it took me so long to get this site back up, but it has been a really good thing.  I'm basically doing what I was doing before (creating and managing Web software projects), but I get paid a lot more when I not doing it on my own.

<strong>#4 - Becoming Catholic</strong>
This is probably the biggest surprise to those who have known me for a while, especially those familiar with my solid Southern Baptist roots.  After about three years of discernment, I finally decided it was the right path for me.  I have had zero regrets since, and my relationships with God and others have strengthened.

<strong>#3 - Visiting Rome</strong>
This was a big deal for many reasons. It was my first trip overseas and because of #4 it was a pilgrimage that has greatly enhanced my faith.  I had a chance to see so many historically and religiously significant landmarks.  The Coliseum, the Pantheon, and St. Peter's are just a few places that blew me away.
I had a chance to see the Pope on three different occasions, which was amazing.  The whole city has a mystical sense about it.  From the history of the Roman gods to being the center of Christianity, it felt very supernatural to be there.  It's definitely a special place where special things happen.
I have a ton of pictures that I'll be adding to the site soon.

<strong>#2 - Losing my grandma</strong>
This was the tough event.  I can say that my grandmother was the nicest, most giving person in the world, and I don't know anyone that knew her that would disagree with me.  Life is definitely different without her, but to know she has been reunited with my grandpa, brother, and all of our other loved ones who have passed on gives me solace.  She is and will continue to be missed here on earth.

<strong>#1 - Getting engaged</strong>
This is the big one.  Numbers five and four on this list paved the way for this to happen and #3 gave me the perfect spot to pop the question (north fountain in St. Peter's square).  So after almost seven years of dating, Juliana and I will be getting married in October.  It's a really exciting time for us.  I'm looking forward to what the future holds.

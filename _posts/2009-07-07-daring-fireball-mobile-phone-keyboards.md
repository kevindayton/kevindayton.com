<a title="http://daringfireball.net/2009/07/mobile_phone_keyboards" href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/07/mobile_phone_keyboards" target="_blank">John Gruber</a> lays out a very well-worded argument for the soft keyboard found on the iPhone.  His argument is similar to what I've told others in that I type very well on the iPhone but horribly on my wife's Blackberry,  with the opposite being true for her.  The point being that practice is required on either the software or hardware keyboard and to completely write off one or the other is ridiculous.

This quote from Gruber regarding Apple's approach sums it up pretty well:
<blockquote>Are software touchscreen keyboards good for everyone? Certainly not. But this is another aspect of the Apple Way. Apple tries to make things that many people love, not things that all people like. The key is that they’re not afraid of the staunch criticism, and often outright derision, that comes with breaking conventions.</blockquote>

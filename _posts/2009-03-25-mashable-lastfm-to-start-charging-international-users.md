<a title="http://mashable.com/2009/03/24/lastfm-international-users/" href="http://mashable.com/2009/03/24/lastfm-international-users/" target="_blank">"The Social Media Guide" points to a new</a> <a title="http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/24/lastfm-radio-announcement" href="http://blog.last.fm/2009/03/24/lastfm-radio-announcement" target="_blank">Last.fm blog</a> post that discusses their new charge for "International" users  to access their streaming radio service.
<blockquote>In order to keep providing the best radio service on the web, we need to ask our listeners from countries other than USA, UK and Germany to subscribe for €3.00 per month. In return you’ll get unlimited access to Last.fm Radio, and a promise that we’ll be hard at work improving the service for years to come.</blockquote>
This isn't a huge surprise considering the ridiculous royalties charged to Internet radio providers.  As Mashable points out, Last.fm competitor Pandora simply cutoff International users.  While I think that people generally overreact to a company charging for something it once gave away, I fear this is the nature of the beast when it comes to dealing with music copyright holders.  The thing with Last.fm is that they offer so many other ways to discover music that are beyond simple streaming.

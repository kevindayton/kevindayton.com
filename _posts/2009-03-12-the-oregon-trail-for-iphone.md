<a href="http://toucharcade.com/2009/03/11/the-oregon-trail-arrives-make-dysentery-fun-again/">‘The Oregon Trail’ has been released</a> for the iPhone (<em>$5.99, <a title="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=307519882&amp;mt=8" href="http://toucharcade.com/link/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=307519882&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a></em>).  This game was my introduction to working on a computer in grade school.  I can still remember sitting down at the <a title="http://oldcomputers.net/trs80iii.html" href="http://oldcomputers.net/trs80iii.html" target="_blank">Tandy</a> and hoping none of my crew came down with dystenery.  Although as you can tell by the trailer, the iPhone take of this game is slightly more graphically advanced.  (Tip to <a title="http://toucharcade.com/2009/03/11/the-oregon-trail-arrives-make-dysentery-fun-again/" href="http://toucharcade.com/2009/03/11/the-oregon-trail-arrives-make-dysentery-fun-again/" target="_blank">touchArcade</a>.)

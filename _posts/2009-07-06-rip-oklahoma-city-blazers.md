I'll admit it.  I had not been to a Blazers' game in a while, but it is still sad to see them just die out even if an <acronym title="American Hockey League">AHL</acronym> team is on the way.  I can definitely remember when they were the only show in town.  In the video above, Ed Kelley of The Oklahoman has a good summation of why Bricktown might not be the Bricktown we know now if it weren't for the <acronym title="Central Hockey League">CHL</acronym> reincarnation of the Blazers.

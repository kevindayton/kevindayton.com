As it turns out, the answer is not very many when it comes to Saul Williams' album.  Reznor reports that only one in five people were willing to pay.  The interview reveals a different side the the "music in the new Internet world" debate.  Reznor comes off very defeated and not sure where to go from here.

"<em>The toothpaste is out of the tube and a whole generation of people is accustomed to music being that way. There's a perception that you don't pay for music when you hear it on the radio or MySpace.</em>," he said.

One idea he has is an ISP music tax, whereby everyone pays around $5 extra and all music on the Web is free.  If it's an optional tax, like taxes of gasoline or cigarettes, I don't think its a bad idea. However, I have a real problem with forcing a tax on people who "legally" acquire most, if not all, of their music collection.

I'm an aspiring amateur photographer.   I just recently put down my 35mm SLR and invested in my first digital SLR.  I'm not all that good yet, but I love taking pictures and capturing unique moments.  I am quite inspired by people who see things in everyday life and envision them as intriguing images.  With that in mind, I found my way to a <a title="http://www.chasejarvis.com/index.php#mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=0&amp;p=5&amp;a=0&amp;at=0" href="http://www.chasejarvis.com/index.php#mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=0&amp;p=5&amp;a=0&amp;at=0" target="_blank">set of photos by Chase Jarvis</a> (h/t <a title="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/28/chase-jarvis" href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/04/28/chase-jarvis" target="_blank">Daring Fireball</a>).  These are pretty amazing pictures on their own.  What is even more amazing is that they were all taken using his iPhone.  Jarvis's opinion is that "the best camera is the one that's with you," and that in almost all cases even a camera phone can result in amazing images.

Jarvis announced Tuesday that he has released a book of his iPhone photos, appropriately named <em>The Best Camera Is The One That’s With You</em>.  He has taken it a bit further by releasing "The Best Camera" iPhone app ($2.99, <a title="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=329800600&amp;mt=8" href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=329800600&amp;mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes link</a>) that allows for photo processing and sharing all within the same app.  Along with the app is an online community for sharing photos at <a title="http://www.thebestcamera.com" href="http://www.thebestcamera.com" target="_blank">www.thebestcamera.com</a>.  This is a really interesting project, and I can't wait to see how it develops.

For more info, watch the introduction by Jarvis in the video below.



<a name="update200909250920"></a>UPDATE:  Reviews in the app store for the iPhone app are generally good, but the biggest complaint is a watermark on images uploaded to Facebook with the text "Uploaded from Chase Jarvis' Best Camera."  Users are rightfully upset that their images from an app they paid for were being tagged this way.  Apparently it was a mistake.  TheBestCamera.com acknowledges it on <a title="http://www.thebestcamera.com/support.html" href="http://www.thebestcamera.com/support.html" target="_blank">their support page</a>:
<blockquote>We have discovered a bug in the app that affects Facebook captions in two ways.<br style="padding: 0px;margin: 0px;border: 0px initial initial" />First, if you do not write a Facebook when uploading your image via the sharing page on Best Camera, your caption says “Uploaded from Chase Jarvis’ Best Camera”. This text was created as dummy text in the development of the app and and was not intended to act as your default caption.<br style="padding: 0px;margin: 0px;border: 0px initial initial" />Second, if you do enter a caption for Facebook and then share your image to BOTH Facebook and thebestcamera.com, your Facebook caption is being replaced by the default caption. The current work around is to upload your image to thebestcamera.com and Facebook separately, thus retaining the Facebook caption you’ve entered.<br style="padding: 0px;margin: 0px;border: 0px initial initial" />

We have built a 1.01 release which will correct both of these problems and is currently in the approval process at the App Store. We’ll announce as soon as the new version is available.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Apple today announced  that it is making several changes to its App Store developer policies and procedures, with one of the most significant changes being an easing of its earlier move to ban third-party compilers  such as Adobe's Flash-to-iPhone compiler it had built into Flash Professional CS5. Under the new policies, such third-party tools will be permitted as long as the apps generated by them do not download any code.</blockquote>
This is a good move that potentially opens app store development to a much larger community and should help get regulators off of Apple's back.Â  I'm excited to see some of the potential tools that could arise, but I am still skeptical as to how Apple will handle this loss in control of the app development process.

<a title="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10194846-37.html?tag=newsEditorsPicksArea.0" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10194846-37.html?tag=newsEditorsPicksArea.0" target="_blank">CNET News reports</a> that invitations are out for a media event next week (March 17) to discuss Apple's iPhone OS 3.0.  Will it be a software-only discussion or will it be hardware too?  The anticipation builds!

UPDATE from <a title="http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/12/iphone-os-3-0-is-coming-march-17th/" href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/03/12/iphone-os-3-0-is-coming-march-17th/" target="_blank">Engadget</a>:
<blockquote>Apple's calling this an "advance preview of what we're building," so we're not expecting anything ready to go as of the 17th, but hopefully this will allow developers to start building toward future functionality (hey, how about some push notifications?), and presumably users won't have too many months to wait after that for the real deal.</blockquote>
Yes, please discuss the absence of push notifications!

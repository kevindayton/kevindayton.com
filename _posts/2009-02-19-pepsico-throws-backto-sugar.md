<a href="http://www.bevreview.com/2009/02/09/pepsi-throwback-mountain-dew-throwback/" target="_blank">BevReview is reporting</a> (via <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/02/sweet-sweet-sugared-pepsi-throwback" target="_blank">kottke.org</a> via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2009/02/18/pepsi-throwback" target="_blank">Daring Fireball</a>) that Pepsi will introduce novelty "throwback" versions of both Pepsi and Mountain Dew that contain actual, real-life sugar and not high fructose corn syrup.  While most people will file this under "who cares," I find it interesting.  In many other countries, soft drinks still use sugar for sweetening.  To echo Gruber from Daring Fireball, I just wish it was Coca-Cola doing this.  I had "real" Coke made with sugar while in Europe, and it is just better.

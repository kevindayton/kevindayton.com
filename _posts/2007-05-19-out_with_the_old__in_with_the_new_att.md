post_excerpt: |
  Outside of my normal obsessions, I'm also strangely fascinated with marketing, branding and advertising campaigns.  When SBC bought AT&amp;T, rebranded itself with the latter, and then bought BellSouth, I was very curious to see how they would fold all of these brands, which include Cingular Wireless, into one 150-year-old name.  You've probably noticed that they've beaten us over head to make clear that "Cingular is the New AT&amp;T."  Thankfully it appears that they are ready to move into a new phase of the marketing transition.

It's an interesting read, if you're into that sort of thing.

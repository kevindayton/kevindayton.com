<a href="http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2010/05/26/apple-will-steve-ballmer-show-up-at-the-wwdc-keynote/">Barrons.com is reporting</a> (h/t <a title="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/26/microsofts-steve-ballmer-to-present-during-wwdc-2010-keynote/" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/05/26/microsofts-steve-ballmer-to-present-during-wwdc-2010-keynote/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>) that Apple have allotted seven minutes of presentation time during Steve Jobs's upcoming Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) to Microsoft.  According to their sources, Microsoft will talk about native iPhone development using Visual Studio 2010.  This would be shocking enough in and of itself given Apple's recent headline grabbing stance on controlling native iPhone development and limiting it to their own XCode application and developers suite.  To make it even more shocking is the idea that none other than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer himself will deliver the presentation.  This could prove to be one of the more interesting twists in the upcoming keynote on June 7.

On a side note, my unconfirmed, completely fictitious sources say that following Microsoft's time, Adobe will be allotted 30 seconds during which CEO Shantanu Narayen, already fuming from the Microsoft announcement, will receive a swift kick in the crotch by Jobs.

<strong>Update</strong>:  Microsoft has apparently shot this rumor down via its <a title="http://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/14850981422" href="http://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/14850981422" target="_blank">Twitter feed</a>:
<blockquote>Steve Ballmer not speaking at Apple Dev Conf. Nor appearing on Dancing with the Stars. Nor riding in the Belmont. Just FYI.</blockquote>

<p><a title="http://newsok.com/devon-officials-put-money-on-doing-their-tower-right/article/3392766?custom_click=lead_story_title" href="http://newsok.com/devon-officials-put-money-on-doing-their-tower-right/article/3392766?custom_click=lead_story_title" target="_blank">In a story on NewsOK.com about the pending construction of the Devon Tower</a>, Oklahoma City's first legitimate skyscraper, I found this quote refreshing:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Klay] Kimker, Devon’s vice president of administration, said he learned from construction of Liberty Tower that if one doesn’t have time to do things right the first time, then that person will face spending even more time fixing mistakes once the task is done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might be thinking, "what is so interesting about common sense like that?"  Unfortunately, I don't think this is common sense any more.  In a time when any time after right now is late, proper planning is usually one of the first areas to get cut off the timeline.  Unfortunately, I've been a part of many projects with a "do it fast, fix it later" mindset.  So it was nice to read that the idea of taking your time and getting it right isn't completely forsaken.</p>

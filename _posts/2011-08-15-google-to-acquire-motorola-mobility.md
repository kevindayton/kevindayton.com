Major news to start the week.  Google will dish out $12.5B for Motorola's mobile phone making arm.  This signals the search giant's first significant commitment to hardware in the mobile space.
<blockquote>The acquisition of Motorola Mobility, a dedicated Android partner, will enable Google to supercharge the Android ecosystem and will enhance competition in mobile computing. Motorola Mobility will remain a licensee of Android and Android will remain open. Google will run Motorola Mobility as a separate business.</blockquote>

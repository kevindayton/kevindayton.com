The developer of <a title="http://www.instapaper.com/" href="http://www.instapaper.com/" target="_blank">Instapaper</a> and one of the founders of <a title="http://www.tumblr.com/" href="http://www.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Tumblr </a>on <a title="http://plus.google.com" href="http://plus.google.com" target="_blank">Google+</a> and <a title="http://www.marco.org/2011/07/11/own-your-identity" href="http://www.marco.org/2011/07/11/own-your-identity" target="_blank">taking ownership of your online life</a>:
<blockquote>If you care about your online presence, <a title="http://www.marco.org/2011/04/05/let-us-pay-for-this-service-so-it-wont-go-down" href="http://www.marco.org/2011/04/05/let-us-pay-for-this-service-so-it-wont-go-down" target="_blank">you must own it</a>. I do, and that’s why my email address has always been at my own domain, not the domain of any employer or webmail service.

You might think your <code>@gmail.com</code> address will be fine indefinitely, but if I used a webmail address from the best webmail provider at the time I broke away from my university address and formed my own identity, it would have ended in <code>@hotmail.com</code>. And that wasn’t very long ago.

...

Locking your identity in won’t prevent a major social service from succeeding. Sadly, most people don’t care about giving control of their online identity to current or future advertising companies.</blockquote>

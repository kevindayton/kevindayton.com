<blockquote>It is a textbook example of why you don’t open your mouth before you’re ready to talk. This was a chance to set the record straight and turn the tables in this debate, and Google blew it. Most of the mistakes made were simple, avoidable failures of communication.</blockquote>
Like Drance, I agree with Google's core premise that the patent system seems broken, but they failed to articulate the core issues and came off as whiny losers under the current rules of the game.

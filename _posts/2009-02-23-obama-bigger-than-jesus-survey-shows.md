A recent Harris Poll (via <a title="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=15160" href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=15160" target="_blank">Catholic News Agency</a>) shows that President Obama's status as a hero has eclipsed that of Jesus in the eyes of Americans.
<blockquote>Respondents most often named Barack Obama, followed by Jesus Christ, Martin Luther King, Jr., Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.

Mother Teresa was the tenth most often named, while God was the eleventh most. (from <acronym title="Catholic News Agency">CNA</acronym>)</blockquote>
Honestly, this doesn't surprise me at all.  The love affair with between the press and Obama is enough to make even moderates like myself queezy, and people think and do what the TV tells them to do.  What does surprise me is that George W. Bush appears on the list ahead of Mother Teresa and God.  If everyone in the world hates ol'  G.W. like we are led to believe, what does that say about our opinion of God?

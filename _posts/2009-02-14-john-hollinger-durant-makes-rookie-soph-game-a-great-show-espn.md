<a title="Rookie Challenge: Durant's soar spot" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/allstar2009/columns/story?columnist=hollinger_john&amp;page=RookieChallengegamer-090214" target="_blank">Great article by John Hollinger of ESPN.com</a> on the "rookie" challenge last night.  It was great to watch three stars playing with "OKC" on the back of their jerseys.  Kevin Durant flat-out dominated.  Along with Jeff Green and Russell Westbrook, it's easy to see why Oklahoma City continues to be excited about the Thunder and fill up the Ford Center.

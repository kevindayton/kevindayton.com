    Today brings news that <a href="http://mysql.com/news-and-events/sun-to-acquire-mysql.html" target="_new" title="MySQL AB :: Sun to Acquire MySQL">Sun has acquired MySQL AB</a>, the corporate entity that develops the open-source relational database management system MySQL.  I don't have much to say about this because I'm not sure what to think.  I know that MySQL AB has been slowed since Oracle acquired Innobase, a company that provided the InnoDB database engine for MySQL that featured capabilities such as referential integrity that allowed MySQL to compete against the likes of Oracle's database offerings.  MySQL AB itself had spurned Oracle's advances before, which makes this acquisition a little surprising.  I have worked and continue to work on projects using MySQL.  It will be interesting to see what unfolds.

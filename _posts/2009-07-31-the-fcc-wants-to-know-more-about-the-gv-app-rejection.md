<blockquote>In letters sent late Friday to the three companies, the FCC asked why Apple rejected the Google Voice application for the iPhone and removed related "third-party applications" from its store.

The letter also seeks information on how AT&amp;T was consulted in the decision, if at all.</blockquote>

According to the article, this is part of a broader investigation of the telecom industry that is looking at AT&amp;T and Verizon specifically for potential anti-competitive behavior.

Hopefully some real answers and positive change will come out of this, but consider me skeptical.

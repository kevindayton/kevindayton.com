Today Skype released an update to their iPhone app that enables multitasking.  Along with it, they announce via their "<a title="http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/07/iphone_multitasking_3g.html" href="http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/07/iphone_multitasking_3g.html" target="_blank">Big Blog</a>" that they won't be charging for Skype-to-Skype calls over 3G as had been announced at their previous update.
<blockquote>At Skype, we believe that better call quality and better availability which is achieved with an app capable of multitasking and/or making calls over 3G lead to increased call frequency and longer calls. We also believe that the mobile world is in a period of significant change, for example, with some operators starting to move to tiered pricing models.

In light of that, we no longer have plans to charge a supplement to make calls over 3G. We’re delighted to make it easier for you to talk for even longer and do even more together using Skype.</blockquote>

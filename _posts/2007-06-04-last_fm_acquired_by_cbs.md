post_title: Last.fm acquired by CBS
author: Kevin L. Dayton
post_excerpt: |
  I'm a little late on this, but last week the folks at <a href="http://last.fm" title="Last.fm">London-based Last.fm</a> <a href="http://blog.last.fm/2007/05/30/lastfm-acquired-by-cbs" title="Last.fm Acquired By CBS">announced that they had been acquired by CBS</a>.  Most "social networking" sites don't really appeal to me, but Last.fm hits me in my soft spot: music + cool tech + obsessive data collection &amp; reporting.
  
  Last.fm is all based around "scrobbling" the songs you play in iTunes, on your iPod, or however you listen to digital music.  Scrobbling reports song plays to a Web server.  Last.fm was born out of <a href="http://www.audioscrobbler.net/" title="Audioscrobbler - The Music Technology Playground from Last.fm">AudioScobbler</a>, but where Last.fm takes off is in connection of it's users based on play history.  They've branched out recently to provide nice Flash-based playlists (see right column) and player.  Anyway, their approach to social networking is especially cool.
  
  Anyway, with CBS acquiring Last.fm, it will be interesting to see what direction they go.  Congrats to the Last.fm team.

Holy Thursday has arrived ushering in Easter's Holy Triduum.  The Holy Triduum is  a three day remembrance of the last days of Jesus's life that leads up to the Easter celebration of his resurrection.  For those who are seeking to learn more about the Holy Triduum, I recommend listening to Fr. John Corapi's three part series covering Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and Holy Saturday.  MP3 versions of these talks can be <a title="http://www.ewtn.com/vondemand/audio/seriessearchprog.asp?seriesID=6007&amp;T1=" href="http://www.ewtn.com/vondemand/audio/seriessearchprog.asp?seriesID=6007&amp;T1=" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>.

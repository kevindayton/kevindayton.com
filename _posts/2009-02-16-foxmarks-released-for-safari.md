I'm about two weeks late on this, but I was very excited to see this morning that Foxmarks <a title="Foxmarks Blog    » Big News: Foxmarks for IE and Safari" href="http://blog.foxmarks.com/?p=560">has released it's Web bookmark syncing software for Safari and IE7</a>.

For those that haven't used <a href="http://www.foxmarks.com/" target="_blank">Foxmarks</a> on <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/?from=getfirefox" target="_blank">Firefox</a>, it is a must have if you surf the Web on multiple computers.  It serves as a Web-based storage and syncing service allowing you to bookmark a site on one computer/browser and have that bookmark show up on all your computers/browsers signed up for the service.  

I have used it for about six months now to keep my office computer's bookmarks in sync with my home computer.  The problem has been that I don't use Firefox at home as much as I do <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/" target="_blank">Safari</a>.  So previously this meant I would have to launch Firefox to get to my bookmarks.  Not anymore!  Foxmarks for Safari gives me access to my bookmarks directly in Safari.  It also uses the existing iPhone bookmark sync framework to keep your iPhone bookmarks in sync too.

There is a caveat.  Currently they only support Safari for <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" target="_blank">Mac OS X</a>, but do plan support for the Windows version.  They do offer support for <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx" target="_blank">IE7</a> along with Firefox, of course, for Windows users.  Check it out a <a href="http://www.foxmarks.com/" target="_blank">http://www.foxmarks.com/</a>.

Oh, by the way, it is free.

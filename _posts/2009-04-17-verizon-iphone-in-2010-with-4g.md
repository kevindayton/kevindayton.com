<blockquote>...the notion of Apple Inc.'s iPhone ever coming to the Verizon Wireless network, saying it is more likely that Apple would be willing to work with the carrier under the fourth-generation, or 4G, network, which follows the same technology standard as AT&amp;T Inc.'s 4G plans. - WSJ via <a title="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/16/verizon-iphone-more-likely-when-4g-networks-arrive-in-2010/" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/16/verizon-iphone-more-likely-when-4g-networks-arrive-in-2010/" target="_blank">Mac Rumors</a></blockquote>
The timeline is interesting with Verizon's 4G network launching in 2010 and AT&amp;T's exclusivity agreement rumored to run out that year.  <a title="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/14/atandt-exclusivity-expires-in-2010-atandt-asking-for-extension/" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/14/atandt-exclusivity-expires-in-2010-atandt-asking-for-extension/" target="_blank">With AT&amp;T said to be trying to extend its pact with Apple</a>, it's easy to <em>assume</em> that Apple might shopping around for new partners.

On a personal note, this timeline is very interesting as Verizon is set to take over Alltel's Oklahoma network in 2010, and my AT&amp;T contract ends mid-year 2010.

After months of rumors that IBM was to acquire Sun, <a title="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10223044-92.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10223044-92.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20" target="_blank">Cnet is reporting</a> that Sun is selling, but not to IBM, rather to Oracle.  The deal is reportedly worth $7.4B.

I you've read my blog, you'll know that my primary concern with the acquisition of Sun from any company is the fate MySQL, which Sun purchased last year.  Leading up to that purchase, Oracle had failed several times to buy MySQL itself, which I was happy about.  MySQL offers database software in a market in which Oracle has yet to find a foothold, and I feared that Oracle acquiring the company might stifle the development of the open source product.

So here we are about a year later and Oracle ends up with MySQL via Sun.  What will happen to MySQL now?  Maybe it will be good for it or maybe bad, or maybe its open source roots will see its core survive under a different name like <a title="http://askmonty.org/wiki/index.php/MariaDB" href="http://askmonty.org/wiki/index.php/MariaDB" target="_blank">MariaDB </a>or <a title="https://launchpad.net/drizzle" href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle" target="_blank">Drizzle</a>.

What do you do when vampires turn out to be demonic monsters and not overly-serious teens?  Call in a secret priestly order trained in destroying those pesky little blood suckers, of course.  That's the central story the upcoming movie "<a title="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0822847/" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0822847/" target="_blank">Priest</a>."

You put all of this in a post-apocalyptic world controlled by the stereotypical fun-hating Church, add a rogue priest, and you have have all the makings for Hollywood gold!  Oh, and there is good news for those of you seeking women's ordination, too.  Turns out that a massive demonic outbreak changes the Vatican's mind on that matter.

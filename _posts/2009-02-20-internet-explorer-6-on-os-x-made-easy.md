In the days of Internet browser compatibility, the days have become rare when you arrive at a site that snubs you for your browser choice.  Well, unless you use a Mac and your company uses <a title="http://www.ultimatesoftware.com/" href="http://www.ultimatesoftware.com/" target="_blank">UltiPro</a> for payroll and administrative info.  All I wanted to do was see my pay stub for today, but the site is <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>-for-Windows-only.

Enter <a title="ies4osx" href="http://www.kronenberg.org/ies4osx/" target="_blank">ies4osx</a>, which allows you to run IE6 on OS X with very little effort.  It uses <a title="http://darwine.sourceforge.net/" href="http://darwine.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Darwine</a> (the Mac port of <a title="http://www.winehq.org/" href="http://www.winehq.org/" target="_blank">Wine</a>) and <a title="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/" href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/">X11</a> to run Microsoft's grumpy old browser.  Making sure to use <a href="http://mike.kronenberg.org/" target="_blank">Mike Kronenberg</a>'s <a title="http://www.kronenberg.org/darwine/" href="http://www.kronenberg.org/darwine/" target="_blank">version of Darwine</a> 1.1.9, the installation went really smoothly. <em> (NOTE: I already had X11 installed.  It is not installed by default.)</em>  About ten minutes later, I was browsing my precious HR info.

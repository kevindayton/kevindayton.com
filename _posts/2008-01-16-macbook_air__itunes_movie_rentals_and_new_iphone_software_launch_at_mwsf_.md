<em>Side view of the new "Macbook Air"</em></div>
The MacWorld San Francisco keynote by Apple CEO Steve Jobs came and went yesterday.  I have to admit that I'm left pretty unimpressed.  I haven't watched the full keynote, but judging from the announcements that came out, nothing really blew me away.  Of course, I bring higher than reasonable expectations into each keynote.  Here are my impressions of the high points.

<strong><a title="Apple - MacBook Air" href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/" target="_blank&quot;">MacBook Air</a></strong>:  This is an ultra-thin addition to the Macbook family.  It's less than one inch thick at it's thickest point.  It has a 64GB solid state storage option (for a whopping $999).  It sacrifices and optical drive for space, but features an ability to "borrow" an optical drive from another Mac or PC on the network.  I think the thinness is cool, but it won't fit in my pocket, so I'd still rather spend all that cash on a loaded <a title="Apple - MacBook Pro" href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/" target="_blank&quot;">MacBook Pro</a>.

<strong><a title="Apple - iTunes - iTunes Store - Movies" href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/store/movies.html" target="_blank&quot;">iTunes Movie rentals</a></strong>:  This idea interests me, but until I have an HDTV and an <a title="Apple - Apple TV" href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/" target="_blank&quot;">Apple TV</a>, I really have no use for it.  Given that the library already includes around 100 HD-quality movies, and I do have a new 20" HD display on my computer, I might try this out to see if an Apple TV is really worth getting when the new TV comes (hopefully soon).

<strong><a title="Apple - Apple TV" href="http://www.apple.com/appletv/" target="_blank&quot;">Apple TV</a></strong>:  Along with movie rentals, they also released an updated Apple TV and dropped the price to $229.

<strong><a title="Apple - iPhone - Guided Tour Update 2 - Large" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/gettingstarted/guidedtourupdate2/" target="_blank&quot;">iPhone software update</a></strong>:  Updates are available that allow for a customizable home screen, enhanced mapping with psuedo-GPS for figuring out where you are, and multi-recipient SMS capability.  Alas, no news on hardware updates, though.  The new maps app is cool, but it guesses your location based on your relationship to cell towers and wi-fi routers instead of GPS.  I want an iPhone badly, but I think I can wait until a 3G version comes out, especially now that AT&amp;T has 3G in Oklahoma City, and it is really fast.  Maybe 3G and true GPS are coming this year. If so, I'm all over it.

<strong><a title="Apple - Time Capsule" href="http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/" target="_blank&quot;">Time Capsule</a></strong>:  This is a product that I just might buy soon.  They have basically released an AirPort wi-fi base station with a hard drive in it that is capable of acting as a wireless backup disk with Leopard's Time Machine.  I'm currently in the market for two things: a) a hard drive for backup and b) an 802.11n wi-fi router with Gigabit Ethernet.  This has them all.  So I am definitely going to check this one out.

Those are the high points.  I'm looking forward to watch the keynote to see if there is anything I missed.  Overall fairly ho-hum compared to previous years, but it's clear Apple doesn't save everything for MacWorld anymore.  So new announcements could be just around the corner.

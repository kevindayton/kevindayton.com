    For almost ten years, my <a href="http://cathedralokc.org" title="The Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help">church's Web site</a> has gone relatively unchanged.  The design had become dated and so had the process to add and update the content on it.  Shortly after joining the church about two and a half years ago, I volunteered to take on or assist in a makeover project.  It took a while for the stars to align, but after starting work a few months ago, we finally launched the redesign this week.

For almost ten years, my <a href="http://cathedralokc.org" title="The Cathedral of Our Lady of Perpetual Help">church's Web site</a> has gone relatively unchanged.  The design had become dated and so had the process to add and update the content on it.

It took a while for the stars to align, but after starting work a few months ago, we finally launched the redesign this week.
<!--break-->
For the first time ever, I used the very popular <a href="http://joomla.org" title="Joomla!">Joomla! CMS</a>.  I have long been a proponent of <a href="http://drupal.org" title="drupal | community plumbing">Drupal</a> over Joomla!, mainly due to the fact that Drupal seems more friendly to those who want to add their own PHP modules quickly.  Joomla!, however, has a very rabid user-base that has produced a large number of usable plug-ins.  This allowed me to produce a professional, interactive site with only a few lines of my own handcrafted PHP.  This was definitely nice.  While I still definitely love Drupal, I can see myself using Joomla! again in the future.

Feel free to let me know what you think of the redesign.

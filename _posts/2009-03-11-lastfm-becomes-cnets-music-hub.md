<a href="http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10188863-12.html" target="_blank">CNET announced last week</a> that today it will begin redirecting requests for its <em>music.download.com</em> site to <a title="http://last.fm" href="http://last.fm" target="_blank">Last.fm</a>.  It's a logical step since they are both CBS Interactive properties and music is what Last.fm is all about.  Still, I imagine that there are a lot of  music.download.com users will find it a hard transition given the different concepts behind the two sites.

I really like Last.fm and think that they bring a really interesting approach to music discovery.  Since more users means more data means better discovery, I hope that this added exposure increases their userbase.

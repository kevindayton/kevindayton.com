On the day that Skype <a title="http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2009/04/skype_for_iphone_zooms_past_on.html" href="http://share.skype.com/sites/en/2009/04/skype_for_iphone_zooms_past_on.html">announced that their iPhone app has surpassed the 1 million download mark</a>, <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/03/skype-for-iphone-sparks-battle-between-consumers-and-carriers/" target="_new">MacRumors notes</a> that there is a growing battle between consumers and carriers regarding their rights when using their mobile phone and service plan.  I, for one, would like to the the VOIP-on-WiFi-only restriction lifted.  I pay for data, and I should be able to use as I like as long as it is within reasonable fair use.  Therefore, I was quite interested to read the following quote from the article.
<blockquote>...an open-Internet advocacy group is <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123876873806886721.html">asking the FCC</a> to see if AT&amp;T and Apple are violating federal rules by restricting Skype to just Wi-Fi.  -- <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2009/04/03/skype-for-iphone-sparks-battle-between-consumers-and-carriers/" target="_new">MacRumors</a></blockquote>

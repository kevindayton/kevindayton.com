As <a title="http://kevindayton.com/2009/03/18/ibm-to-buy-sun/" href="http://kevindayton.com/2009/03/18/ibm-to-buy-sun/">mentioned a couple of weeks ago</a>, IBM is looking to acquire Sun. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/technology/business-computing/03blue.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology" target="_new">According to the NY Times</a>, the acquisition appears to be imminent for a cool $7 billion (h/t <a title="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/04/03/1321221&amp;from=rss" href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/04/03/1321221&amp;from=rss" target="_new">Slashdot</a>).

My main question is "what will happen to MySQL?", especially in the midst of <a title="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/30/228214" href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=09/03/30/228214" target="_new">confusion over what the real version of the popular DB software really is</a>.  According to the Times article, though, MySQL could be a key reason that IBM is making this move.
<blockquote>I.B.M.’s acquisition of Sun would disrupt that long partnership with Oracle. I.B.M. could also undercut Oracle by more actively promoting the free MySQL software, which has become the most popular database software with Internet companies.  -- NY Times article</blockquote>
My gut says <a title="http://www.zend.com/" href="http://www.zend.com/" target="_new">Zend</a> is next.

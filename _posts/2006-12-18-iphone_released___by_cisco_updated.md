  As predicted late last week, the iPhone family was finally released today.  One thing was missing though, Apple.  Instead Cisco, through its sub-brand Linksys, <a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_News_C2&amp;childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;cid=1165633352046&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper" title="Linksys.com - Press Release/Linksys Announces iPhone Family Of Voice Over IP Solutions" target="_blank">released a series of home VoIP phones</a> under the "iPhone" moniker.

As predicted late last week, the iPhone family was finally released today.  One thing was missing though, Apple.  Instead Cisco, through its sub-brand Linksys, <a href="http://www.linksys.com/servlet/Satellite?c=L_News_C2&amp;childpagename=US%2FLayout&amp;cid=1165633352046&amp;pagename=Linksys%2FCommon%2FVisitorWrapper" title="Linksys.com - Press Release/Linksys Announces iPhone Family Of Voice Over IP Solutions" target="_blank">released a series of home VoIP phones</a> under the "iPhone" moniker.

What is funny about all of this is that throughout all the speculation and rumor mongering, the term iPhone was supposed to be a given.  This assurance was based on the fact that the domain name "<a href="http://iphone.org" target="_blank">iPhone.org</a>" was supposedly registered to Apple.  In fact, as of my typing, it redirected to Apple's front page.  Despite the fact that anyone could drop $10 to register that domain as Apple and point it to <a href="http://apple.com" target="_blank">Apple.com</a>, this trivial fact seemed to cover up the trademark that Cisco has held on the term "iPhone."

It's clear now that Apple's branding will go a different direction.  It seems to me (and my 6 hours of college marketing credits) that pushing the iPod name might be the way they're are leaning.  "iPod Mobile" or something to that affect seems much more likely.  Why not ride the iPod branding as long as you can.  Then again, those who try to predict Apple's next move, let alone how they will brand and market it, deal with more misses than hits.

Update:  It has been pointed out to me that Apple has indeed <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/pages/2006/10/20061016171333.shtml" title="Apple iPhone Trademark, Analyst Speculation">sought to register the brand "iPhone"</a> in a number of other countries, despite not holding the mark in the U.S.  So maybe an iPhone isn't completely out of Apple's plans.

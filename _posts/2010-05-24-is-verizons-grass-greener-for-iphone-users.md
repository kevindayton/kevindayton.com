<blockquote>It’s easy to think that the grass is always greener away from AT&amp;T, but keep in mind that these are cellular carriers: massive oligopolists that don’t give a s*** about us. Their phones are ARPU vending machines, first and foremost, not communication tools. Cellular carriers are only a small step above cable and phone companies in the contempt and disregard they show for their customers.</blockquote>
This sums up my thoughts on wireless phone companies.  I don't think I could have said it any better.

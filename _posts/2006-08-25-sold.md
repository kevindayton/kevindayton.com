    With the site being down for quite some time, I felt like I had to come back with a bang.  By reading "Top 5 Things To Happen While I Was Gone", you can probably tell that I've been pretty busy, but the timing of the site coming back online coincides with other big news.  Juliana and I have bought a house!

We weren't really in the market, but had an opportunity to by a duplex that was recently gutted and renovated.  We were intrigued by it the first time we saw it, and a week later we agreed on a contract to buy it.  We'll get Juliana moved in a week prior to the wedding, and I'll follow after the honeymoon.  We're probably a little crazy to set this kind of timetable, but we felt this place was perfect for us to start out in.

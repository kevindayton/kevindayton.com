China is considering making it's currency convertible and thus, potentially open for trade.  <a title="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timcollard/100005531/will-china-make-its-currency-convertible-or-would-it-rather-own-the-united-states/" href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timcollard/100005531/will-china-make-its-currency-convertible-or-would-it-rather-own-the-united-states/" target="_self">This blog post by Tim Collard</a> of The Daily Telegraph (London) looks at why they are considering this, but more importantly, the frightening reason for Americans that they are in no hurry to do so.
<blockquote>Yes, the non-convertibility of their own currency does mean they are forced to maintain massive dollar reserves; but they are in no hurry to replace the dollar with the renminbi as a reserve currency. It would look good: but they can live with massive holdings of US Treasuries, warming their hearts with the thought that democratic (small “d”) irresponsibility is fast turning the USA into a wholly owned subsidiary of the [People's Republic of China].</blockquote>

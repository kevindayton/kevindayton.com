From <a href="https://threatpost.com/en_us/blogs/pandora-mobile-app-transmits-gobs-personal-data-040611" target="_blank">ThreatPost</a>:
<blockquote>That free service comes at a price, <a title="http://www.veracode.com/blog/2011/04/mobile-apps-invading-your-privacy/" href="http://www.veracode.com/blog/2011/04/mobile-apps-invading-your-privacy/" target="_blank">Veracode found</a>. Researchers who took  apart the application and studied its code found libraries for five  different ad networks embedded in the Pandora application. Those  libraries collected and trasmitted a variety of different data from the  Android phone and its owner. The data included both the owner's GPS  location and tidbits the owners gender, birthday and postal code  information. There was evidence that the app attempted to provide  continuous location monitoring - which would tell advertisers not just  where the user accessed the application from, but also allow them to  track that user's movement over time.</blockquote>
I tend to overreact when it comes to privacy concerns, but I think this represents a legitimate concern for everyone in the era of free mobile apps.  While the developer might not give up personal data maliciously or even knowingly, advertisers who offer up software packages to developers for ad placement might be slightly more nefarious.  App developers should be cautious as to what info their apps are divulging, and consumers should realize that  "free" doesn't always mean "free".  You might be giving up a lot more personal info than you think.

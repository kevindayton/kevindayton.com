<p><a title="http://www.usccb.org/romanmissal/examples.shtml" href="http://www.usccb.org/romanmissal/examples.shtml" target="_blank">The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has posted</a> a side by side comparison of the new English translation of the Novus Ordo<sup>1</sup> Mass.&nbsp; The hope for this translation is that it will be truer to the original Latin.&nbsp; This is a very good thing as it brings the English words closer to those being said in the many other local languages of the Church.&nbsp; There will, however, be a great deal of kicking and screaming over this.&nbsp; Some will scream that this doesn't go far enough.&nbsp; Some will see this as going backward, and some will simply oppose change from anything to which they have grown accustomed.&nbsp; Like seemingly  everything in the Church today, there will no doubt be a loud debate once these changes start getting implemented, but in the long run I hope people will cool down after they get used to it.&nbsp; (h/t <a title="http://www.americanpapist.com/2009/08/important-side-by-side-changes-to-mass.html" href="http://www.americanpapist.com/2009/08/important-side-by-side-changes-to-mass.html" target="_blank"><i>American Papist</i></a>)</p>
